# azapi_resource (Resource)

This resource can manage any Azure Resource Manager resource.

## Example Usage

 ```terraform
 terraform {
   required_providers {
     azapi = {
       source = "Azure/azapi"
     }
   }
 }
 
 provider "azapi" {
 }
 
 provider "azurerm" {
   features {}
 }
 
 resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
   name     = "example-rg"
   location = "west europe"
 }
 
 resource "azurerm_user_assigned_identity" "example" {
   name                = "example"
   resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
   location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
 }
 
 // manage a container registry resource
 resource "azapi_resource" "example" {
   type      = "Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries@2020-11-01-preview"
   name      = "registry1"
   parent_id = azurerm_resource_group.example.id
 
   location = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
   identity {
     type         = "SystemAssigned, UserAssigned"
     identity_ids = [azurerm_user_assigned_identity.example.id]

## Schema

### Required

- `type` (String) In a format like `<resource-type>@<api-version>`. `<resource-type>` is the Azure resource type, for example, `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts`. `<api-version>` is version of the API used to manage this azure resource.

### Optional

- `body` (Dynamic) A dynamic attribute that contains the request body.
- `create_headers` (Map of String) A mapping of headers to be sent with the create request.
- `create_query_parameters` (Map of List of String) A mapping of query parameters to be sent with the create request.
- `delete_headers` (Map of String) A mapping of headers to be sent with the delete request.
- `delete_query_parameters` (Map of List of String) A mapping of query parameters to be sent with the delete request.
- `identity` (Block List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--identity))
- `ignore_casing` (Boolean) Whether ignore the casing of the property names in the response body. Defaults to `false`.
- `ignore_missing_property` (Boolean) Whether ignore not returned properties like credentials in `body` to suppress plan-diff. Defaults to `true`. It's recommend to enable this option when some sensitive properties are not returned in response body, instead of setting them in `lifecycle.ignore_changes` because it will make the sensitive fields unable to update.
- `location` (String) The location of the Azure resource.
- `locks` (List of String) A list of ARM resource IDs which are used to avoid create/modify/delete azapi resources at the same time.
- `name` (String) Specifies the name of the azure resource. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `parent_id` (String) The ID of the azure resource in which this resource is created. It supports different kinds of deployment scope for **top level** resources:

  - resource group scope: `parent_id` should be the ID of a resource group, it's recommended to manage a resource group by azurerm_resource_group.
	- management group scope: `parent_id` should be the ID of a management group, it's recommended to manage a management group by azurerm_management_group.
	- extension scope: `parent_id` should be the ID of the resource you're adding the extension to.
	- subscription scope: `parent_id` should be like \x60/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\x60
	- tenant scope: `parent_id` should be /

  For child level resources, the `parent_id` should be the ID of its parent resource, for example, subnet resource's `parent_id` is the ID of the vnet.

  For type `Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups`, the `parent_id` could be omitted, it defaults to subscription ID specified in provider or the default subscription (You could check the default subscription by azure cli command: `az account show`).
- `read_headers` (Map of String) A mapping of headers to be sent with the read request.
- `read_query_parameters` (Map of List of String) A mapping of query parameters to be sent with the read request.
- `replace_triggers_external_values` (Dynamic) Will trigger a replace of the resource when the value changes and is not `null`. This can be used by practitioners to force a replace of the resource when certain values change, e.g. changing the SKU of a virtual machine based on the value of variables or locals. The value is a `dynamic`, so practitioners can compose the input however they wish. For a "break glass" set the value to `null` to prevent the plan modifier taking effect. 
If you have `null` values that you do want to be tracked as affecting the resource replacement, include these inside an object. 
Advanced use cases are possible and resource replacement can be triggered by values external to the resource, for example when a dependent resource changes.

e.g. to replace a resource when either the SKU or os_type attributes change:

```hcl
resource "azapi_resource" "example" {
  name      = var.name
  type      = "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses@2023-11-01"
  parent_id = "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/example"
  body      = {
    properties = {
      sku   = var.sku
      zones = var.zones
    }
  }

  replace_triggers_external_values = [
    var.sku,
    var.zones,
  ]
}
```
- `replace_triggers_refs` (List of String) A list of paths in the current Terraform configuration. When the values at these paths change, the resource will be replaced.
- `response_export_values` (Dynamic) The attribute can accept either a list or a map.

- **List**: A list of paths that need to be exported from the response body. Setting it to `["*"]` will export the full response body. Here's an example. If it sets to `["properties.loginServer", "properties.policies.quarantinePolicy.status"]`, it will set the following HCL object to the computed property output.

	```text
	{
		properties = {
			loginServer = "registry1.azurecr.io"
			policies = {
				quarantinePolicy = {
					status = "disabled"
				}
			}
		}
	}
	```

- **Map**: A map where the key is the name for the result and the value is a JMESPath query string to filter the response. Here's an example. If it sets to `{"login_server": "properties.loginServer", "quarantine_status": "properties.policies.quarantinePolicy.status"}`, it will set the following HCL object to the computed property output.

	```text
	{
		"login_server" = "registry1.azurecr.io"
		"quarantine_status" = "disabled"
	}
	```

- `retry` (Attributes) The retry block supports the following arguments: (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--retry))
- `schema_validation_enabled` (Boolean) Whether enabled the validation on `type` and `body` with embedded schema. Defaults to `true`.
- `tags` (Map of String) A mapping of tags which should be assigned to the Azure resource.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `update_headers` (Map of String) A mapping of headers to be sent with the update request.
- `update_query_parameters` (Map of List of String) A mapping of query parameters to be sent with the update request.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) In a format like `<resource-type>@<api-version>`. `<resource-type>` is the Azure resource type, for example, `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts`. `<api-version>` is version of the API used to manage this azure resource.
- `output` (Dynamic) The output HCL object containing the properties specified in `response_export_values`. Here are some examples to use the values.

	```terraform
	// it will output "registry1.azurecr.io"
	output "login_server" {
		value = azapi_resource.example.output.properties.loginServer
	}

	// it will output "disabled"
	output "quarantine_policy" {
		value = azapi_resource.example.output.properties.policies.quarantinePolicy.status
	}
	```

<a id="nestedatt--retry"></a>
### Nested Schema for `retry`

Required:

- `error_message_regex` (List of String) A list of regular expressions to match against error messages. If any of the regular expressions match, the error is considered retryable.

Optional:

- `interval_seconds` (Number) The base number of seconds to wait between retries. Default is `10`.

- `multiplier` (Number) The multiplier to apply to the interval between retries. Default is `1.5`.
- `randomization_factor` (Number) The randomization factor to apply to the interval between retries. The formula for the randomized interval is: `RetryInterval * (random value in range [1 - RandomizationFactor, 1 + RandomizationFactor])`. Therefore set to zero `0.0` for no randomization. Default is `0.5`.


<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:
