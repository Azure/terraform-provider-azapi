Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task.

This condition can be detected via the node state and scheduling error detail. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete.
